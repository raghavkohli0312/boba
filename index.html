        <strong>Minecraft</strong> is a sandbox game developed and published by Mojang Studios. 
        Formally released on 18 November 2011 for PCs following its initial public alpha release on 17 May 2009, 
        it has been ported to numerous platforms, including mobile devices and various video game consoles. <br><br>
        In Minecraft, players explore a procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain made up of voxels. 
        Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. <br><br>
        Depending on the game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in multiplayer. 
        The game's large community offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, player skins, texture packs, 
        and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities. <br><br>
